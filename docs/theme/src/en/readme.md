## Use themes

You can use [vuepress-theme-hope template](https://github.com/Mister-Hope/vuepress-theme-hope-template) directly to start your vuepress journey.

### Install

```bash
npm i -D vuepress-theme-hope
```

### Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
const resolve = require("vuepress-theme-hope/resolve");

module.exports = resolve({
  // your config here
});
```

::: tip
The purpose of introducing the resolve function is to give you full hints through TS's Interface and JSDoc when you edit the configuration.

At the same time, the resolve function will also complete some default configurations for your current configuration which will pass directly to vuepress.
